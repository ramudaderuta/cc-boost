# Design Document: Boost-Directed Tool-Calling

## Architecture Overview

The boost-directed tool-calling feature introduces a hybrid execution model where high-tier models receive tool information in their message content and provide guidance to auxiliary models that can actually execute the tools. The design maintains backward compatibility while adding a new execution path for tool-enabled requests.

## System Components

### 1. Request Router Enhancement
The existing request router will be extended to detect when boost mode is enabled for the requested model tier and route requests through the boost execution path.

### 2. Boost Model Manager
New component responsible for:
- Managing connection to the boost model API
- Constructing messages with tools embedded in content
- Parsing structured responses from boost model
- No tool execution capability

### 3. Response Parser
New component that:
- Extracts ANALYSIS and GUIDANCE sections
- Handles various response formats
- No tool execution involved

### 4. Auxiliary Model Request Builder
Constructs requests for the auxiliary model including:
- Original user request
- Boost model's ANALYSIS and GUIDANCE
- Full tool definitions in the proper tools parameter
- Can actually execute the tools

### 5. Response Processor
Handles:
- Converting final responses back to Claude API format
- Maintaining streaming support
- Error handling and fallback logic

## Wrapper Format Design

### Boost Model Message Structure
```
You are a boost model assisting an auxiliary model. Your response MUST follow ONE of these three formats:

FORMAT 1 - SUMMARY RESPONSE (when no tools needed):
SUMMARY:
[Provide the final answer directly without using auxiliary models]

FORMAT 2 - GUIDANCE FOR AUXILIARY MODEL (when tools needed):
ANALYSIS:
[Reasoning and understanding of the request context (trace the context, uncertainties, and potential solution paths sequentially, refining thoughts while keeping continuity)]

GUIDANCE:
[Instructions for the auxiliary model's tasks (include which tools to call and what operations to perform, and the content of the operations should be detailed)]

FORMAT 3 - OTHER (any other response will trigger a loop retry):
[Any response that doesn't match FORMAT 1 or 2]

---
Current ReAct Loop: [loop number, 0-2]
Previous Attempts: [if any, list previous responses that failed]

User Request: [original request]

Available Tools:
[tool definitions embedded as text, not as a tools parameter]
- search_web: Search the web for information. Parameters: query (string)
- read_file: Read a file from the filesystem. Parameters: path (string)
- write_file: Write content to a file. Parameters: path (string), content (string)
- bash: Execute bash commands. Parameters: command (string)
- grep: Search text in files. Parameters: pattern (string), path (string)

Example FORMAT 1:
"SUMMARY:
The capital of France is Paris. This is a straightforward factual question that doesn't require any tools."

Example FORMAT 2:
"ANALYSIS:
The user wants to create a comprehensive summary of Python async programming. Initial context: This requires both current best practices and existing documentation. First uncertainty: Whether the existing documentation is up-to-date. Potential path 1: Search web first for latest practices, then check local docs. Potential path 2: Check local docs first, then supplement with web search. Refining thought: Path 1 is better as it ensures we have the most current information before reviewing existing material. This will help identify gaps in the existing documentation.

GUIDANCE:
1. Call search_web with query: 'Python async programming best practices 2024'
2. Call read_file with path: '/project/docs/async_guide.md'
3. Call write_file with path: '/project/async_summary.md' and content: Combine the web search results with the existing documentation to create a comprehensive summary"

Important Notes:
- If you provide GUIDANCE but the auxiliary model doesn't use the tools, this will trigger a retry
- You have maximum 3 attempts (loops) to get the response right
- Be clear and specific in your GUIDANCE to ensure tools are actually used
```

### Response Parsing
- Uses regex/string matching to extract sections
- No JSON parsing required
- Graceful handling of missing sections
- Check for SUMMARY section to determine if auxiliary model is needed

## Data Flow

```
1. Claude Code Request → Request Router
2. Router checks if boost enabled for model tier
   - No: Use existing direct proxy path (send request directly to auxiliary model with tools, standard tool-calling flow)
   - Yes: Initialize LOOP = 0, route to boost execution path
3. Boost Model Manager:
   - Constructs message with tools in content (no tools parameter)
   - Includes current LOOP count in context
   - Calls boost model API
   - Receives structured response
4. Response Parser:
   - Extracts ANALYSIS, GUIDANCE, and SUMMARY sections
   - Determines response type:
     * If SUMMARY exists: Skip auxiliary model, return SUMMARY directly
     * If GUIDANCE exists: Proceed with auxiliary model
     * If neither: Increment LOOP, check if LOOP >= 3
   - No tool execution at this stage
5. Loop Control:
   - If LOOP >= 3: Return current best response to user
   - If LOOP < 3: Go back to step 3 with refined context
6. Auxiliary Model Builder (only when GUIDANCE exists):
   - Combines original request + ANALYSIS + GUIDANCE
   - Adds tools parameter with actual tool definitions
   - Sends to auxiliary model for execution
7. Tool Usage Detection:
   - Monitor if auxiliary model actually calls tools
   - If tools called: Process results and return to user
   - If no tools called: Increment LOOP, go back to step 3
8. Response Processor:
   - Formats final response (from FINAL, auxiliary model, or loop exit)
   - Streams back to Claude Code
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Tools in Message Content
- Tools embedded as text in the message for Boost model
- No tools parameter sent to Boost model
- Enables awareness without execution capability

### 2. Conditional Two-Stage Execution with Loop
- Boost model plans and provides guidance
- If SUMMARY section present: Direct response without auxiliary model
- If GUIDANCE present: Auxiliary model executes with actual tools
- If neither present: Increment loop and retry (max 3 iterations)
- Tool usage detection: If auxiliary model doesn't use tools, increment loop
- Clear separation of concerns with optimization for simple queries

### 3. No Tool Execution for Boost
- Boost model cannot call tools directly
- Only provides instructions for tool usage
- Maintains compatibility with providers that disable tools

### 4. Fallback Strategy
- Boost model failures fall back to direct execution
- Missing sections don't break the flow
- Graceful degradation always available

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance
- Up to 3 boost calls maximum, auxiliary call only when needed
- No tool execution in boost phase
- Connection pooling for both model APIs
- Optimized for simple queries that don't need tools
- Early termination when FINAL response is received
- Smart loop exit when tools aren't actually used

### Scalability
- Stateless design allows horizontal scaling
- Minimal memory overhead per request
- Configurable timeouts for each stage

### Security
- Boost API keys stored like other provider keys
- Only auxiliary model has tool execution access
- No security risk from boost model

## Loop Mechanism Details

### Loop State Management
- Each request maintains a LOOP counter (0, 1, 2)
- Loop counter is included in Boost model context for awareness
- Previous responses are included to avoid repetition

### Loop Triggers
1. **Boost model response doesn't match format**: Neither SUMMARY nor GUIDANCE detected
2. **Auxiliary model doesn't use tools**: Receives GUIDANCE but doesn't call any tools
3. **Incomplete guidance**: GUIDANCE is present but insufficient for execution

### Loop Behavior
- Each iteration includes:
  - Previous Boost response(s) for context
  - Current LOOP count
  - Refinement request if previous attempt failed
- Maximum of 3 iterations prevents infinite loops
- Graceful fallback to best available response

### Context Preservation
- Accumulated context across iterations
- Failed attempts logged for debugging
- Progressive refinement hints

## Extension Points

The design supports future enhancements:
- Custom wrapper templates via BOOST_WRAPPER_TEMPLATE
- Different tool embedding strategies
- Caching of boost model responses
- Advanced parsing patterns
- Configurable maximum loop iterations
- Adaptive loop strategies based on request complexity
